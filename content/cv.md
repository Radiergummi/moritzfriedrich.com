Professional experience
-----------------------
{{<cv_item position="Engineering Lead" company="MessengerPeople" from="Jan 2020" to="today">}}
As the project lead of the [Unified Messaging API](https://www.messengerpeople.dev), I'm product owner, core contributor
and coordinate sales and marketing decisions across the company. Originally, I built the system from scratch in tandem 
with our CTO [@MaxTietz](https://twitter.com/maxtietz), taking care to design a fully scalable automation solution.  

Over time, I have worked on [several interesting projects](/projects) here.

{{<cv_item position="Software Engineer" company="MessengerPeople" from="Aug 2018" to="Jan 2020">}}
As a software engineer, I was working on a multitude of projects, including things like [the most complex chatbot we ever built](https://www.messengerpeople.com/de/die-besten-chatbots/#ChatbotVonovia), bringing modern PHP to existing applications or slowly migrating _the entire tech stack_ to Kubernetes.

{{<cv_item position="Systems Administrator" company="Boxhorn-EDV" from="Mar 2015" to="Jul 2018">}}
After my apprenticeship, I worked as a sysadmin for three years, gathering extensive experience with technical requirements of small to medium businesses. During that time, I got my hands on almost all parts of IT: Local networks, VPNs, OS and software management, huge Wi-Fi deployments, telephone systems, server rack assembly, monitoring and maintenance, tools research, medical appliances - the list could go on.  
I consider myself fairly confident with almost any kind of technology.

Open Source Engagement
----------------------
In my spare time, I really enjoy working on open source projects, too. Coding, or solving problems in general, is 
something I am deeply passionate about. I have catered to this need over the years by contributing to lots of different
open source projects.

{{<cv_item position="Core Member" company="Anchor CMS" from="Mar 2013" to="today">}}
[Anchor CMS](https://anchorcms.com) is a minimalistic content management system with a focus on simplicity and 
expandability. While teaching myself PHP, I came in contact with the core team and ultimately joined them.

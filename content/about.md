Hi! I'm Moritz, a full-stack developer with a focus on the backend side of things. Currently, I'm head of engineering at [Matchory](https://www.matchory.com), a startup from Germany.  

I usually work with PHP, Node.js and Go on the backend projects and Vue(x) for frontend stuff. The rest of my preferred tech stack includes Docker, Redis, RabbitMQ,
and MySQL. I have written about [some of my past projects](/projects) here in more detail.

If you need more info, please refer to my [CV](/cv) or [Developer Story](https://stackoverflow.com/users/story/2532203) on Stack Overflow.

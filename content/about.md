Hi! I'm Moritz, a full-stack developer with a focus on the backend side of things. Currently, I'm working for [MessengerPeople](https://www.messengerpeople.com),
a startup from Munich, as the head honcho of the [Messaging API](https://www.messengerpeople.dev).  

At MessengerPeople, I've got the opportunity to work on and lead several super interesting projects on the bleeding edge of technology. That includes migrating
the existing, legacy PHP (5.6) stack with a homegrown framework onto a solid foundation: After lots of pain and sweat and tears, we're now proud (product) owners
of a Kubernetes setup with modern PHP (>=7.3), Composer packages everywhere and a fluent build pipeline.

Aside from PHP I also work on the frontend side of things, albeit honestly, I prefer the PHP ecosystem. For GUI projects, I'm usually working with Vue(x).

If you need more info, please refer to my [CV](/cv/) or [Developer Story](https://stackoverflow.com/users/story/2532203) on Stack Overflow.

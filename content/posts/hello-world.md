**Hello darkness, my old friend...**  
This is _not_ the first time I'm attempting to write regularly. As it usually happens, you start enthusiastically with a thought or twice at 
the edge of your brain, eager to be put in words, thinking _"Oh yeah! This time, I'm going to do it! I'm finally making a blog!"_ -- until 
you actually start doing so.  

Now, in my previous attempts, one of two things might happen:

 1. Burning with aforementioned vigor to write, I find myself in front of a white sheet of paper or blinking cursor, _completely and utterly 
    lost and unable to write a single word down._ Somehow, expressing abstract thoughts in your head is easier than capturing them in words.
 2. Well... how would such a blog look like? I mean I know computer stuff, shouldn't it be, like, **the absolute best platform there is**?  
    It goes without saying, it must be implemented in the best-possible, shiniest way as to make every visitor bow before my genius! And off
    I go, wasting countless hours researching current CMS platforms, end up with static site generators, start researching go templates, set
    up a new Netlify account -- and suddenly, all that fun about writing a blog has disappeared into thin air.

So to conquer my usual ways of failing, I've attempted to fool myself by removing as much friction from the process as I can. This blog uses
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the beautiful [_Call me Sam_ theme from Victoria Drake](https://github.com/victoriadrake/hugo-theme-sam), 
which is a sane choice and most importantly _limits me in most ways possible_.  
The only thing I can reasonably do is write Markdown posts, which is a format that comes so natural to me I use it for almost any free text
I write.

The last few years, I've been heavily invested in the tech scene. I've contributed to Open Source, read Hackernews several times a day and 
put countless hours into all sorts of projects, experiments and new tech. This is still huge and important for me: I have a deep fascination
for technology and knowledge. Nevertheless, there's a certain fatigue I cannot shake off; some things just don't seem too important anymore:
Take Hugo, my static site generator, for example. I know the few-years-younger-me would have loved to get opinionated about this. Now, that
choice has become completely irrelevant to me, as long as the thing spews out valid HTML -- and it does!  
All that indifference brings a certain freedom, though: If meaningless choices don't hold me up, my mind is ready for other things.

In the end, this is probably just a sign of growing up, getting wiser. Or thinking you get wiser because otherwise getting older would be
even more frustrating than it already is. Either way, there's lots of things I need to write about, give a shape -- understand.
